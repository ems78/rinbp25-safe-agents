# System Architecture

## Overview

SafeAgents is designed as a modular, microservices-based architecture that separates concerns between different system components. The system comprises three main services:

1. **Backend Service (Node.js/Express)**
   - Handles API requests and orchestrates system operations
   - Manages connections to databases
   - Processes user inputs and controls workflow

2. **Analysis Service (Python)**
   - Executes AI agent security analysis
   - Performs graph analysis on vulnerability relationships
   - Processes attack patterns and generates insights

3. **Frontend Application (React)**
   - Provides user interface for system interaction
   - Visualizes vulnerability relationships and analysis results
   - Manages user sessions and input validation

## System Components

### 1. Data Storage Layer

#### MongoDB (Attack Pattern Storage)
- Collections:
  - `attack_patterns`: Stores known attack patterns and techniques
  - `analysis_results`: Stores results of AI agent analysis
  - `agent_profiles`: Stores AI agent configurations and metadata

#### Neo4j (Relationship Graph)
- Nodes:
  - `Vulnerability`: Represents identified vulnerabilities
  - `AttackVector`: Represents methods of exploitation
  - `Impact`: Represents potential impact of successful attacks
- Relationships:
  - `EXPLOITS`: Connects attack vectors to vulnerabilities
  - `LEADS_TO`: Represents impact chains
  - `RELATED_TO`: Shows related vulnerabilities

### 2. Service Layer

#### Backend Service
- **API Gateway**: 
  - RESTful endpoints for system interaction
  - Request validation and sanitization
  - Authentication and authorization
- **Data Access Layer**:
  - MongoDB connection manager
  - Neo4j graph database interface
  - Data models and schemas
- **Business Logic**:
  - Analysis workflow orchestration
  - Result processing and aggregation
  - System state management

#### Analysis Service
- **AI Testing Module**:
  - Agent interaction handling
  - Pattern matching engine
  - Vulnerability detection
- **Graph Analysis**:
  - Relationship mapping
  - Basic path analysis
  - Pattern detection
- **Results Processor**:
  - Data aggregation
  - Report generation
  - Insight extraction

### 3. Presentation Layer

#### Frontend Application
- **Components**:
  - Dashboard view
  - Analysis configuration
  - Results visualization
  - Graph explorer
- **State Management**:
  - User session handling
  - Data caching
  - Real-time updates
- **Visualization**:
  - D3.js graph rendering
  - Chart and metric displays
  - Interactive analysis tools

### 4. Security Layer

#### Sandboxed Environment (Daytona)
- Isolated testing environments
- Resource usage monitoring
- Environment cleanup and reset

#### Access Control
- Role-based access control
- API authentication
- Session management

## Communication Flow

1. **Analysis Workflow**:
   ```
   User Request -> Frontend -> Backend API -> Analysis Service
   -> Databases -> Analysis Service -> Backend -> Frontend
   ```

2. **Data Access Pattern**:
   ```
   Service -> Data Access Layer -> Connection Pool 
   -> Database -> Results -> Service
   ```

## Deployment Architecture
